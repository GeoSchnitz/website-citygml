We have researched the state of the art of the application of 3D city models, and published it in the following paper (open access):

Biljecki F, Stoter J, Ledoux H, Zlatanova S, and Çöltekin A (2015). Applications of 3D City Models: State of the Art Review. *ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information*, 4(4): 2842-2889. DOI: [10.3390/ijgi4042842](http://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4042842)

In summary, we have found 29 use cases in which 3D city models provide added value:


| Use case | Example of an application |
| --- | --- |
| Estimation of the solar irradiation | Determining the suitability of a roof surface for installing photovoltaic panels |
| Energy demand estimation | Assessing the return of a building energy retrofit
| Aiding positioning | Map matching |
| Determination of the floorspace | Valuation of buildings | |
| Classifying building types | Semantic enrichment of data sets |
| Geo-visualisation and visualisation enhancement | Flight simulation |
| Visibility analysis | Finding the optimal location to place a surveillance camera |
| Estimation of shadows cast by urban features | Determination of solar envelopes |
