# What is CityGML?

CityGML is a common information model and XML-based encoding for the representation, storage, and exchange of virtual 3D city and landscape models. 
It provides a standard model and mechanisms for describing common 3D objects founds in cities, for instance buildings, roads, bridges, vegetation, etc.
Their geometry, topology, semantics and appearance can be stored in that model.
It also defines different levels of detail (LoDs) for the different 3D objets.

Included are also generalization hierarchies between thematic classes, aggregations, relations between objects, and spatial properties. 
CityGML is highly scalable and datasets can include different urban entities supporting the general trend toward modeling not only individual buildings but also whole sites, districts, cities, regions, and countries.

It should be noticed that CityGML provides much more than 3D content for visualization by diverse applications. 
It allows users to share virtual 3D city and landscape models for sophisticated analysis and display tasks in [different application domains]({{ site.baseurl }}/applications).

<!-- CityGML has been implemented in many software solutions and is in use in many projects around the world. In National Spatial Data Infrastructure programs in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Malaysia, Abu Dhabi and other countries, CityGML provides an important platform for the transition from 2D to 3D data. It also plays an important role in bridging Urban Information Models with Building Information Models (BIM) to improve interoperability among information systems used in the design, construction, ownership and operation of buildings and capital projects. -->

It is realised as an open data model and is implemented as an application schema for the [Geography Markup Language 3 (GML3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211. 
Because CityGML is based on GML, it can be used with the whole family of GML-compatible OGC web services for data accessing, processing, and cataloging like the Web Feature Service, Web Processing Service, and the Catalog Service. 

CityGML is an open standard that can be used free of charge.


<!-- # Background -->

<!-- In recent years, most virtual 3D city models have been realised as purely graphical or geometrical models, neglecting the semantic and topological aspects. Thus, these models could almost only be used for visualization purposes but not for thematic queries, analysis tasks, or spatial data mining. Since the limited reusability of models inhibits the broader use of 3D city models, a more general modeling approach had to be taken in order to satisfy the information needs of the various application fields. -->

CityGML is being developed since 2002 by the members of the [Special Interest Group 3D](http://www.ikg.uni-bonn.de/sig3d) (SIG 3D) of the initiative [Geodata Infrastructure North-Rhine Westphalia](http://www.gdi-nrw.org/) (GDI NRW) in Germany. 

It is now a standard developed and maintained by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org).

<!-- The SIG 3D is an open group consisting of more than 70 companies, municipalities, and research institutions working on the development and commercial exploitation of interoperable 3D models and geovisualization. 
 -->

<!-- The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations that can be shared over different applications. This is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of 3D city models, allowing to sell the same data to customers from different application fields. The targeted application areas explicitly include city planning, architectural design, touristic and leisure activities, environmental simulation, mobile telecommunication, disaster management, homeland security, vehicle and pedestrian navigation, and training simulators. -->
